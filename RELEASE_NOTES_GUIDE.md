# Release Notes Guide

This repository uses a custom release notes system that allows you to write detailed release notes for each version.

## How It Works

1. **Edit `RELEASE_NOTES.md`** - Update this file with your custom release notes before creating a new release
2. **Create a new release** - The GitHub release will use your custom notes
3. **Automatic fallback** - If no `RELEASE_NOTES.md` exists, it will use a default template

## Release Notes Format

The `RELEASE_NOTES.md` file should contain your release notes in Markdown format. Follow this structure:

```markdown
